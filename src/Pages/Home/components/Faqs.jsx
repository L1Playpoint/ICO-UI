          <Typography>
            Technically, PPTT is a fungible token on the Avalanche Ecosystem,
            similar to any ARC20 Token or Currency. However, PPTT can be used as
            a utility and a tradable token. This means it can be used inside
            Playpoint and can be withdrawn. By doing so, we can achieve trading
            of PPTT on external or decentralized exchanges outside of our
            control.
