            Technically, PPT is a fungible token on the Binance Smart Chain
            blockchain, similar to any BEP20 Token or Currency. However, PPT can
            be used as a utility and a tradable token. This means it can be used
            inside Playpoint and can be withdrawn. By doing so, we can achieve
            trading of PPT on external or decentralized exchanges outside of our
            control.
